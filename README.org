** Installing dependencies
*** PySMT
+ We have provided a [[file:install_pysmt_boolector.sh][script]] which can automate the installation of PySMT and Boolector.
+ We use a [[https://github.com/soarlab/pysmt][fork]] of PySMT that has support for fixed-point primitives. Clone and install using =python setup.py install=.
+ Use =pysmt-install= to install the solver of your choice. We used [[https://github.com/Boolector/boolector][Boolector]] which can be installed with =pysmt-install --btor=.
*** Gurobi
+ Download the Gurobi optimizer tar.
+ Extract and move it under =/opt=.
+ =cd /opt/gurobixxx/linux64/= where =xxx= refers to the specific gurobi version.
+ Add =/opt/gurobixxx/linux64/bin= to =$PATH=.
+ Install python bindings using =python setup.py install=.
+ =export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gurobi952/linux64/lib=
*** GLPK
+ Install GLPK using =sudo apt install glpk-utils=.
*** Python
+ =pip install tensorflow numpy bitstring=
